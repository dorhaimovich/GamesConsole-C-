# GamesConsole - C++

I had a college Exercise for Class diagram implementation with cpp.

The "main" runs the game 2 times.
each time with different difficulty, every difficulty has a different algorithm.

I made it so that it would be accessible for adding games.

for more board games just create a new file with class that Inheritance from "BoardGame".
